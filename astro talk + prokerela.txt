Your Vimshottari Dasha Details
Vimshottari dasha is the most important and most supreme dasha as per vedic astrology. There are 9 dashas divided over a period of 120 years. Each dasha has a ruling planet and the life of a person is directly influenced by the nature of his/her ruling planet governing a particular dasha. The first Maha dasha is determined by the position of the natal moon in a given nakṣatra.

Mangal Dosha Analysis Report
The person is Manglik
The person is Manglik and since Mars is positioned in the 7th house, it indicates strong Manglik Dosha
However The person's Mangal dosha has been cancelled due to following reasons:
​ Mangal dosha is cancelled as Mars is in Kumbha, in the 7th house in your horoscope.








Raja Yoga
Special Combination of Planets in the Horoscope (Applicable Yogas)
A unique characteristic of Indian astrology are the yoga’s. Yoga’s are planetary positions that lead to a certain result. In Vedic astrology, the associations planets form or variations of how they are placed in the chart are referred to as Yogas.


Special And Important Yogas in your birth chart
​ Gajakesari Yoga
Someone with Gaja Kesari Yoga is considered to be really lucky. This yoga is as a result of the Moon and Jupiter coming together by being in the 1st, 4th, 7th, or 10th Kendra from each other. It is believed that a person born with this yoga in their horoscope will be blessed with the intellect of an elephant and the grandeur of a lion. For one to truly benefit from the Gajakesari yoga, the aspect and conjunction must be at the most optimum position. This is why we don’t see the true positive effect of the Gaja Kesari Yoga in the lives of all those who are supposedly born with this yoga in their horoscope. In this chart Jupiter is in kendras from Moon.

​ Musala Yoga
When all the planets and the Lagna are in the Fixed signs like Taurus, Leo, Scorpio and Aquarius, a Musala yoga is the end result. Those with this yoga tend to be very straight forward about their ethos and principles in life. Administrative jobs are an excellent career choice for such people. Fame and prestigious achievements are likely to follow such people as a reward for their diligence. However such individuals don't roll well with change. Flexibility is definitely not their forte.

​ Raja Yoga
A typical Raja Yoga happens when two or more than two planets (out of which atleast one should be the lord of 'Kendra' & the other should be the lord of 'Trikon') is in a relationship with each other. This relationship can be a combination, bidirectional vision or exchange of zodiacs. A person with a Raja Yoga enjoys social status and fame. Recognition and laurels will follow them for their efforts on various matters. In this chart there is relationship between Sun, Moon & Mercury planets.


Moon Based Yogas in your birth chart
​ KemaDruma Yoga
Kemadruma Yoga is formed when the second and twelfth house from the moon is not occupied by any planet (except Sun, Rahu and Ketu). This leaves either side of Moon empty, making it weak. Struggles and Poverty is typical of a person born with Kemadruma Yoga. Being away from family and loved ones is also seen in such natives. Some remedies that are advised to minimise the negative effects of Kemadruma yoga is: Fasting on Purnima days for four consecutive years is known to minimise the negative effects of Kemadruma yoga. You may begin this fast starting from a Purnima that happens on a Monday or even from the day of Chitra nakshatra whenever it falls on a Monday. Pay a visit to Siva's temple on Mondays and perform abhisheka using cow’s milk on Shivalinga Worshipping Lord Shiva and goddess Parvati is advised. Reciting the Shivapanchakshari mantra ‘Om Namah Shivaya’ with a Rudraksha mala is also specially helpful. Reading the Sri Sukta regularly and keeping a Dakshinavarti shell in the house is also helpful. Fill water in the Dakshinavarti shell and puse this water to perform abhisheka on the idol of of Goddess Lakshmi. Wearing a Sri Yantra set in silver with a pearl is also especially helpful for Kemadruma natives.

Sun Based Yogas in your birth chart
​ Veshi Yoga
Veshi yoga is formed when the planets Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter or Saturn is in the second house from Sun. Person born in this yoga do not discriminate between people. They are religious and they are usually happy go lucky people. In this chart planet Mars is in the 2nd house from Sun.

​ Vaasi Yoga
Vashi yoga is found in a birth chart when any planet except Rahu, Ketu and Moon is placed in the twelfth house from the Sun. Wealth, luxury and joy are seen to follow those with this yoga. Those with Vaasi yoga have a likeable personality and are talented, intelligent, systematic and diligent in anything that they undertake. They are honest and true to their words at all times. In this chart planet Venus is in the 12th house from Sun.

​ Ubhayachari Yoga
Ubhayachari yoga is seen in a person's birth chart when there are any planets except Rahu, Ketu and Moon in the second house and twelfth house from the Sun. The natives of this yoga enjoy good health and will be surrounded by friends wherever they go. In this chart planets Venus & Mars are on either side of sun.


Inauspicious Yogas in your birth chart
​ Grahan Yoga
One of the most inauspicious yogas in astrology is Grahan Yoga. This occurs when either the Sun or Moon is with either the Rahu or Ketu in a birth chart. Depending on the houses impacted in Grahan Yoga, various spheres of life are impacted. Promises are seldom kept and trying to find an escape route to run away from their responsibilities becomes a part and parcel of the native's life. In this chart Sun is in Ketu.

​ Kuja Yoga
The Kuja Yoga also known as Mangal Dosa or Mangalik Dosa is formed when Mars is in the 1st, 4th, 7th, 8th and 12th house of a chart. Some remedies to appease the Mars god are: When two people with Kuja Dosha enter a married life, the negative effects are cancelled. Chanting Navgraha mantra is helpful. Meditating and chanting on Gayatri Mantra and Hanuman Chalisa is particularly helpful. Worshipping Hanuman and visiting a Hanuman temple on Tuesdays is helpful. Observing a fast on Tuesdays is also helpful. In this chart Mars is in Kendra.

Ashtakvarga Chart
Ashtakvarga is used to assess the strength and patterns that are present in a birth chart. The Ashtakvarga or Ashtakavarga is a numerical quantification or score of each planet placed in the chart with reference to the other 7 planets and the Lagna. In Sarva Ashtaka Varga the total scores of all the BAVs are overlaid and then totalled. This makes the SAV of the chart. The total of all the scores should be 337.

|| Your Ascendant ||
Nakshatra is the term for lunar mansion in Hindu astrology. A nakshatra is one of 27 (sometimes also 28)
sectors along the ecliptic. Each nakshatra is further subdivided into quarters (or padas). These play a role in
popular Hindu astrology, where each pada is associated with a syllable, conventionally chosen as the first
syllable of the given name of a child born when the moon was in the corresponding pada.
Your Nakshatra : VISHAKHA
Your Nakshatra Pada : 3
Vishakha Nakshtra Prediction : If there has to be a word for you, it will be “determined”. You put all your
dedication to achieve what you desire for. That is why it is important for you to decide the motive. After that,
you just put all your energy into it. You just like to work all the time. There is a desire in you to get more
comforts in life and you consider celebration, love, and luxury as important parts of life. Your features are sharp
and eyes are beautiful. You are courteous, social, and alway stay happy. Your voice is sweet and you never
speak bitterly to anyone. Education-wise, your situation is good. Due to the effect of Jupiter, you have an
excitement about getting knowledge from your childhood. You are good with studies; that is why you will get
high education. When it comes on physical hard work, you try to avoid that. However, you use your brain a lot.
If you are considered from a social angle, your circle is quite big because you are quite friendly in nature. You
behave quite lovingly and respectfully with people. If someone needs you, you always come to their rescue.
This is the reason why people come to you when you need them most. You are also associated with the
institutions dealing with social welfare. Conservative or old traditions have no value in your life. You don’t
want anything bad for anyone in life. Your voice is vibrant, which attracts people. Hence, if you try your hand
in politics, you can do a lot of social welfare. When it comes on earning daily bread, you prefer doing job rather
than business. You will put hard efforts to get a government job. Even if you will do business, you will try to
keep terms with the government in some way. Your situation is quite good financially and sudden monetary
benefits are also expected. Lottery etc. may also benefit you. You already enjoy saving money and all these
things will help you in that. Financial strains will never be felt by you and even if you felt something like that, it
will be quite temporary.
Education & Income : You try to excel uniquely in everything, which can make you successful always.
Favorable professions for you are fashion designing; modelling; stage performer; radio & television; politics;
army; dance; custom; police; security force; security guard; etc.
Family Life : You love your life partner and children very much, and try to spend more time with them.
When it comes on family, you prefer living in a joint family. You are quite attached with your family and also
you know very well how to take care of your family.

|| Nakshatra Phal ||
Character
You have several desirable qualities. First and foremost, you revel in work and there is hardly a limit to the
amount of work you can do. Next, you have your eyes wide open and your brain is alert. Taken together, these
qualities single you out as being a very powerful influence in your own sphere of activities.You are wonderfully
practical in all you do, and you have a very keen brain for remembering details. In fact, details mean so much to
you that you are apt to irritate some of your co-workers with them. You never forget a face, though you are less
accurate in remembering names.You are a person who wants to know the why and where of everything. Until
you are satisfied on these points, you refrain from acting. Consequently, sometimes you miss a good deal, and
some people look upon you as a procrastinator.In a measure you are too sensitive and often you hold back when
you should go ahead. This unfits you for certain forms of leadership. You do not want your own way in many
things. In fact, you are very amenable, taken all round.
Happiness And Fulfillment
You are a practical person. You have the ability to systematically organise your life, sober-mindedly realising
that you must work for success. You tend to be a loner, preferring to think and study, and excel at solving
difficult problems. Sober and cautious, you can be completely fulfilled if you will view life with more
optimism. You are usually happier in life when you come to the realisation that life is not as bad as you thought
it be.
Life Style
You are concerned about how others will regard you intellectually and are motivated to direct your efforts
toward education before any other areas.

|| Life Predictions ||
Career
Because you are patient and want a career with permanence, it is hardly necessary for you to rush. Pursue a
career in an area such as banking, Government service, Insurance Companies where you advance slowly but
surely. Not only will you be much better off in the long run, but you have the patience and the attitude to see it
through.
Occupation
Whatever you turn to, you will engage in with all your might - one at a time. Then, if monotony or routine plays
a large part in the chosen occupation, you will become restless and look for a complete change. Accordingly,
you must see to it that, at the outset, you choose a form of work possessing plenty of variety. You should think
of nothing that keeps you seated in an office, since you need movement. There is much in a commercial
traveller's work that will appeal to you. But, there are thousands of jobs, which will take you from place to place
and where you will constantly seeing fresh faces, that will be suited to your requirements also. You have an
excellent executive ability which fits you for ruling you own right after you reach the age of 35. Moreover, at
about this time, you become unfitted for serving under others.
Health
You are well favoured as far as your constitutions are concerned. But, you are liable to suffer from nervous
disorders and indigestion. The first is the direct outcome of your highly sensitive nature. You become exhausted
more quickly than the average person and the life you enjoy does not help in the matter. Digestive troubles
result from self-indulgence. Too much is eaten. What is eaten is too rich and, very often, it is eaten too late in
the day. There is a tendency to corpulence in later life.

|| Life Predictions ||
Hobbies
You are rich in mental interests and the more cultured arts mean a good deal to you. You find more pleasure in
planning a holiday than in actually going over the itinerary. You love books and reading, and enjoy rambling
over a museum. You are having a peculiar interest in old, particularly very old things.
Love Matters
In love matters, you are just as vigorous as you are in work and play. Once you fall in love, you want to be in
the company of your intended-one every available minute of the time. You are too wise to neglect your work.
But, once the work is accomplished you will hurry off to trysting-place to keep the appointment. When
marriage is an accomplished fact, you will want to rule the home. The ruling will not be done, necessarily in an
aggressive manner, it will certainly be efficient. If you are a woman, you often help your husband in his
business affairs and this you perform with marked efficiency.
Finance
You are not likely to be lucky with partners in business. You will be more likely to be architect of your own
fortune than receive much help from others. But, there is no reason for you not to eventually succeed and even
become wealthy. In matter of finance, your quick-witted clever brain will give you great opportunities. At times
your are likely to be very rich and at other times the reverse. When you have money you will be extravagant,
when without it you can adapt yourself to the lowliest sphere. In fact, the greatest danger is that you are by
nature too adoptable to others as well as to conditions. If you made the effort to hold your nature in check, you
would easily become a success in whatever enterprise, industry or work you became associated with.

|| Life Predictions ||
Education
You are quite practical, which is why you tend to assess any situation in this manner only. You have the
necessary consciousness and eligibility to grasp knowledge. You develop interest in knowledge which has
practical information to offer. You will be counted among the intelligent students and with the help of your
sharp intellect and logical reasoning abilities, you will pass difficult exams with flying colours. You will
possess great wisdom from your childhood and observe and learn from other human beings. Your memory
power will be quite strong and you may distinctly remember each and every activity of your past for a long
time. This will also benefit your studies and you will touch great heights educationally. But refrain yourself
from maintaining an overtly practical attitude.

Generally Manglik Dosha is considered from the position of Lagna and Moon in the birth chart.
In the birth chart, Mangal is placed in Seventh house from Lagna, while in the Moon chart Mangal is placed in
Fifth house.
Hence Mangal Dosha is present in Lagna Chart but not in Moon Chart.
Mangal Dosha is considered to create hurdles in the married life of a person. According to some, Mangal Dosha
results in frequent illness or ultimately death of partner(s).
It is considered that if a manglik person marries to another manglik person then the manglik dosha gets
cancelled and has no effect.
Some Remedies (in case Mangal Dosha is present)
Remedies (needs to be performed before marriage)
Kumbha Vivah, Vishnu Vivah and Ashwatha Vivah are the most popular remedies for Mangal Dosha.
Ashwatha vivaha means the marriage with peepal or banana tree and cutting the tree after that. Kumbha Vivah,
also called Ghata Vivaha, means marriage with a pot and breaking it after that.
Remedies (can be performed after marriage)
1.Keep Kesariya Ganapati (Orange coloured idol of Lord Ganesha) in worship room and worship daily.
2.Worship Lord Hanuman by reciting Hanuman Chalisa daily.
3.Mahamrityunjaya paath (recitation of Mahamrityunjaya mantra).
Remedies (based on Lal Kitab, can be performed after marriage)
1.Feed birds with something sweet.
2.Keep ivory (Haathi Daant) at home.
3.Worship banyan tree with milk mixed with something sweet.
Note: We strongly recommend you to consult an astrologer before performing these remedies by your own.

Shani Sade Sati: Rising Phase
This is starting period of Shani's Sade Sati. In this period Saturn will be transiting in 12th house from the Moon.
It generally indicates financial loss, problems by hidden enemies, aimless travel, disputes, and poverty. During
this period, you may face problems created by your hidden enemies. Relationship with your colleagues will not
good enough and they will create problems in your work environment. You may also face challenges on your
domestic front. This may create pressure and tension. You need to exercise control over your spending
otherwise it be lead to bigger financial problems. Long distance travels may not be fruitful during this period.
Saturn’s nature is of delay and dejection, but generally you will get results eventually, so be patient and wait for
your turn. Take this period as learning period, put your hard work and things will fall in place. You are advised
not to take high risks in business matters in this period.
Shani Sade Sati: Peak Phase
This is the peak of Shani's Sade Sati. Generally this phase of Saturn is the most difficult one. Saturn transiting
over natal Moon indicates health problems, character assassination, problems in relationship, mental afflictions,
and sorrows. You will find it difficult to achieve success in this period. You may not get results of your hard
work and feel restricted. Your constitution and immune system will not be strong. As first house is the house of
health, you should start exercising and taking care of your health, otherwise you can be caught by chronic
diseases. You may suffer from depression, unknown fear or phobia. Your will lack clarity in thinking, action,
and decision making. You will be spiritually inclined and will be attracted by intricacies of nature. Acceptance
and doing basics right will sail you out of this period.
Shani Sade Sati: Setting Phase
This is 'setting' period of Shani's Sade Sati. Saturn will be transiting in the 2nd house from the natal Moon,
which indicates difficulty on financial and domestic front. You will start feeling slight relief after having two
difficult phases of Sade Sati. Still, misunderstandings and financial stress can be seen during this period.
Expenses may keep soaring high and you need to continue exercising control. Sudden financial losses and fear
of theft is also a possibility. You may be pessimistic in thinking, you are advised to deal with matters
enthusiastically. You will require paying good attention to family and personal front, otherwise those can also
lead to a bigger problem. For students, education may be slightly affected and they will have to work harder to
hold on to their existing level. Results will be slow and almost always with the delay. This is a period which
indicates danger and apart from other things, you need to be careful while driving. If possible, stay away from
non-veg and your drinking habits to keep Saturn happy. You will be able to sail through this period by
intelligently handling your domestic and financial matters.
Note: Above predictions are of general nature and are based on general belief that Sade Sati is harmful. Truly
speaking, we found that it is not always the case and we recommend reading this article on Sade Sati. Any
conclusion based on Sade Sati alone is not correct and has good chances of failing. Certain factors like current
running dasa and nature of Saturn also needs to be analyzed before we can conclude whether Sade Sati period
will be malefic or benefic. You are advised not to take above forecasts seriously and in case of any doubt,
consult a good astrologer.

Kalsarpa Dosh/Yog
As per the current definition, when all planets are situated in middle of Rahu and Ketu in birth-chart or
horoscope, the astrologers call it Kalsarp Dosh. In present days, discussions about this dosh are vogue among
Jyotishi or Hindu Astrologers of India. Many of troubles in one's life are mostly because of Kalsarp Dosh.
Without analyzing other areas of astrology, most astrologers, in fact, accept kalsarp dosh is main root of
problems. But the reality is this that if all planets are well posited in horoscope, kalsarp dosh will not be
harmful, and can be supportive to beneficial results endowed by good positions of planets. Kalsarp dosh is
inauspicious when positions of planets are unfavorable in one's horoscope. Therefore, it is not wise to fear
hearing just about 'Kalsarp Dosh'. It is in fact always better to reach on remedies only after consulting jyotishi
for deep analysis on negative influences of Kalsarp dosh. Interestingly, influence of kalsarp dosh is different in
different people. Because influence of kalsarp dosh is based on points-which sign is posited in which house, and
what other planets occupied that house, what are their influences and so on.
Result: Your Horoscope is free from Kalsarpa Yoga

Shadbala is a method in Vedic astrology that gives quick insight in the strength of planets and the houses.
Sanskrit means 'Six' and hence Shadbala consists of 6 different sources of strength. Shadbala calculation is a
laborious process but thanks to computers one can get these strength calcualtions by just one mouse click.
Shadbala method gives a value to each planet and each house. The more points a planet and a house gets in
Shadbala the stronger it is.

General Predictions Related to Native
General Characteristics :-
Your Ascendant falls in the Leo sign. This sign has been classified as a fiery, fixed or grave sign.
Certain other natural qualitative characteristics have also been attributed to it: this sign is sterile and
bestial by nature.
For being born in this Ascendant, you are likely to be endowed with an impressive appearance and
firm disposition; your nature will be proud and fearless - rich in life and feeling. You will be ambitious
- fond of pomp and magnanimity; but you will always resent any kind of clique and secrecy. You will
be very rude towards your adversaries and will be determined to destroy them at any cost. You will be
very courteous and generous as well; will remain ever optimistic, high-spirited, and oblivious to
enmity. You will have unique adaptable quality and will easily mingle yourself with new / changed
conditions. You will get success in your ventures easily and will achieve your goal. Your desired
aspirations will be accomplished.
You will have a serious disposition, determined nature, and always believe in keeping promises and
fulfilling commitments. You will be traditionalist and will have a firm believe in traditions and
conventions. You will have a desire of living freely like a king. You will be authoritative and will
command others. You will hate restrictions. For your majestic qualities, you will turn many heads and
attract the attention of the people occupying authoritative positions. You will be faithful and kindhearted, for which reason people in your circle will treat you with due respect. Your outlook towards
life will be spiritual and philosophical. You will believe in God's existence and will have respect for
him. You will not commit sinful acts. You will not be envious and malicious.
You will be nature loving and like to visit forest and hilly areas. You will have an inclination towards
literature, music and art. Your attitude will be positive. You may have an intense desire to come to the
fore; and for fulfilling your objective, you may work hard for acquiring some special abilities.
In your chart, the Moon is situated in sign Libra - the sign signified by a weighing balance as a symbol
of Divine Justice - which is ruled by Venus. It is a movable, positive, and airy sign. You will be
endowed with a kind, generous, and humane nature, and an amiable sympathetic disposition; your
mind will be well balanced, and your imagination will be very fruitful. You will attach due importance
to peaceful home-life, be a votary of harmony, and steadfastness in affection will be your main
SUPRIYA
characteristic quality. You will rise in your life by dint of your own merit and abilities, while you may
also face sudden fall or dislocation owing to your own fault or blunder-like mistake. You are likely to
get married to someone hailing from a family of higher socio-economic status, but you may lack
harmony in your married life owing to wide differences - not only in backgrounds, but also in
principles.
If some benign modifying influences are not present in your chart, you may not be very happy in your
early childhood - it might be due to financial inconveniences, but more probably owing to one of your
family-members - who might have become a source of insurmountable worries to you. But later the
situation will be considerably improved - possibly taking effect with change of place of residence -
which may and can happen when you would join in a profession, and/ or get married. Such a change
would surely be a landmark in your life.
You will have a genial nature, but you may at the same time have some inherent weakness also - as
you are prone to be influenced by males quite easily; you might also be disposed to some undesirable
habits and sheer extravagance - these might take you on the verge of ruin. Although you will be very
intelligent and quite clever, and understand the general affairs of business and profession pretty well,
your nature could be always somewhat unsteady and dwindling, and your restless mind may encourage
you to go abruptly off the course for pursuing a perceived golden goose that is wrongly believed to lie
within easy reach - just on the greener side of the fence.
You may pursue some hobby that may some years later become your mainstream of profession; in
addition or alternately, at the same time or at two different times, you may follow two different
streams of profession. The situation will however improve for the better - as you would mature with
age and experience. All your life, you will remain faithful to your friends, and oblivious to your
enemies. For your sense of probity and justice, you will command due appreciation, admiration and
respect from the people in general.
Physical Appearance :-
Your complexion will be reddish. You are likely to have an impressive physical structure. Your face is
likely to be oval shaped and the forehead may be prominent. Your distinctive features will be your
upright walk with a sunny cheerful disposition. With these, you will be the center of attraction
wherever you go.
